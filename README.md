# Enc-Dec-feature-reverse
Reverse vm protected application file to get the powerful Enc, Dec features

# Project Description & Requirements
Original Source Filename: Avatar_auth_tool v.1.1.0
Project name: Reverse Engineering an exe file protected by VMprotect(Virtual Machine)
Tool download url: https://mega.nz/file/FvASmBhJ#bWj0S6ZvwZqHXwbNRum20DcWwi2ThlwjqjViuqC1pHY
Purpose: This program(or tool) sends an encrypted string to the server and the server responds encrypted string. I want to use their API to create a new tool. That is why I need encryption and decryption functions.
Result: Extract enc dec algorithm of API from their tool(Avatar_Auth_Tool_V1.1.0)
Language: implement with one of php, python, c++, delphi
Timeline: 10 days including the test period(it may be done earlier)
There will be 2 milestones:

First milestone:
We will start working on your project and get the result that you want in this milestone. After you check the encryption or decryption module for one API and you are satisfied with the result, you must release this milestone and create a second milestone as well.
Second milestone:
Once you create the second milestone, I will share the source code with you and if you are satisfied with the algorithm, you will have to release this milestone too.
Note:
If they upgrade to a new version after you release 2nd milestone, I will support you for free until the first upgrade.

# Detailed Description.
In original source file, Avatar_auth_tool v1.1.0, there are encrypt and decrypt features for the text.
we must get the feature code from the original file, to show the results we must implement php server which provide API for encrypt the text and decrypt the text again.
